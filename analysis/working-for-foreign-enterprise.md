## Relationship between employer and candidate

The foreign country needs that the candidate accomplishes the following requirements:

- Someone who talks the language very fluently
- Someone who can work along the time zone that the employer needs
- Someone who understands the culture from the foreign country
- Someone who is experienced in working with foreign countries
- Someone who understands about complex projects
- Someone who goes along with the team mates

On the other side, United States and countries from Europe carries its own currency and this currency could vary from the local currency candidate.

If the EURO currency would be converted into ARS (Argentina' currency) then we should calculate the hour value that belongs to a working day and also, this belongs to an annual salary.

Annual salary is used as measure salary reference in United States and Europe. 

The reason why the research for a job in a foreign country is not successful at times, it is because there is not a good relationship among Hispanic spoken countries and non-Hispanic spoken countries.

The foreign employer requires that the candidate might highlight his/her skills over the other ones and it should be shown before having the first interview.
