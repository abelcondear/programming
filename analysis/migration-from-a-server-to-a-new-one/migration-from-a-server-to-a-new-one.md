## Migration from a server to a new one

Firstly, we should perform the next steps:

- List all installed applications.
- List all installed software.
- List all hardware features of the current server.
- List either performance or functional problem that server went through at times before.
- List installed operative system and its own features.

Secondly, we should start the migration, following the next steps:

- Install applications from the list previously made.
- Install software from the list previously made.
- Compare every actual hardware featureâ€™ server against the old server. Then we should make sure the new server is physically more optimal.
- Review every either performance or functional problem which the old server carried out. Then we should make sure the new server does not persist that same problem.
- Compare the actual operative system and its features against the old server. Then, we should make sure the new server is better according to the installed software.

In case, we cannot run some applications over the new server, we should perform the next steps:

- Those applications which could not be executed or could not run properly, then we either have to uninstall it or redo the application again so that it can be executed successfully.
- Those applications which could not be executed or could not run properly, then we could consider the next options:
    - Hire an external company that let the server be hosted in a cloud like Amazon, Azure, Google Cloud, so on. Then, we could installed such those applications using the hardware and software features needed in order to make it executable.
    - Hire an external company that let the server be hosted physically inside a private room among other servers which belong to other clients. Then, we could installed such those applications using the hardware and software features needed in order to make it executable.


## Migration from a server to a new one using AI

Firstly, we should perform the next steps:

- List all installed applications using AI in order to make it automatically and faster.
- List all installed software using AI in order to make it automatically and faster.

Secondly, we should start the migration, following the next steps:

- Install applications from the list previously made using AI in order to make it automatically and faster.
- Install software from the list previously made using AI in order to make it automatically and faster.

Finally, we should create a diagram that shows the installed applications and software in the old server and new one. In order to do this, we should do:

- Use AI to create dynamically a diagram that makes visible the differences between the old server and new server according to the items installed.
- Use AI to create a diagram that shows the performance and execution time about every installed application.
